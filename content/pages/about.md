My name is Cary Goltermann. I have a degree in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder. I am currently a Data Scientist and Associate Instructor of Data Science for the Data Science Immersion program at Galvanize Denver, the first cohort of which I was a student in.

In my spare time I train for bouldering at the Denver Bouldering Club, where I also work on gymnastics skills.
