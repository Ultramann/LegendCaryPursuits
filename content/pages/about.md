My name is Cary Goltermann. I have a degree in Physics and Matematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder. I am currently a student in the Data Science Immersion program at Galvanize Denver. 

In my spare time I train for bouldering at the Denver Bouldering Club, where I also work on gymnastics skills.
