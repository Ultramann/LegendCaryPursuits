Summary: When it comes to data science, I have soooooo much to learn... Who am I kidding? That claim is by no means specific to data science.

While I came into the DSI course thinking that I would be well prepared to soak up the wealth of information that was going to be presented to me over the 12 weeks, I've come to realize that many of the generalizations that I had read and heard about the course before enrolling were true. Primarily, that since all the students come from varying backgrounds, each one will struggle with their own set of challenges and will be able to help their peers with topics in which they are strong.

For myself, I have found my background in math and programming to be a great foundation upon which to learn the new data science concepts that we see daily. However, since I have very little experience in practical applications of these topics, I find myself nodding along during lecture only to be the last out of the gate when given an assignment. 

In my mind this begs the question, is this a bad thing, and either way, what can I do about it? First, no, I don't think that my lack of practical experience is a bad thing, that's just where one of the many holes in my swiss cheese block of knowledge lies. When it comes to addressing this shortcoming, I am mainly just trying to do more studying ahead (and atail?) of time to build out my understanding of personally weaker topics. Specifically, plotting and anything involving inferential statistics, mostly because I know that these general concepts, while decidedly dissimilar, are going to be very important throughout the rest of the course, not to mention in my career as a data scientist.

For a moment, I would like to address the issue of knowledge swiss cheese from a slightly more meta perspective, in case any future perspective DSI students happen to have the misfortune of stumbling upon this blog. While I find myself with a good framework, math and programming-wise, to build data science knowledge upon, many of my peers have a knowledge base that is the complement (set-wise) of mine, and I have noticed that their experiences in class, while different, are fundamentally the same as mine. There are a number of my peers who come from a slightly softer science background than me. This has manifested in them knowing a great deal about inferential statistics and less about their theoretical underpinnings, and they have also have less experience programming. While this means that they find some topics trivially easy, they certainly still have stumbling blocks. 

The really cool thing about the way that this course is set up is that we have paired programming assignments in the afternoon. This puts all of us in situations where we can constantly learn from each other, and on the flip side have to opportunity to teach things that we know well. Personally, I very much enjoy the structure of the course, as I have learned from my peers as much as I have shared knowledge with them.

The other prophecy about DSI that has defintiely come to fruition for me is that there was no ceiling to the amount of precourse work that I could have done to make me feel better prepared for the course. Consider the first line of the readme for the precourse repository:
> "I wish I did more precourse stuff." –every single Zipfian graduate.

Many of the things that we have been going over in the last two weeks were in the precourse assignment that we all had to complete before the start of classes. And, while I finished all of the assignments, I still am finding myself with sticking points, as the motif of this entire post suggests, in case you, the reader, somehow missed that point.

### Notes
I'm going to really quick get the promised to myself stuff out of the way because I need to go learn some inferential statistics before class starts this morning. Last time I said that I was going to start recording my eating and workouts. That hasn't really happenned :( Yeah I've done it a few times, but, by no means have been consistent with the endeavor. I'm going to try and get better at that. On the plus side, I have been finding time to workout more and have been slightly less dog-tired. So hopefully that's indicitive of my getting better at functioning under my current circumstances and therefore will have fewer excuses to be skimping on my commitments. Trying again, I'm going to say that I want to commit to getting at least one strength workout in this weekend, which already promises to be a busy one. I know, though you might not, that this commitment would normally be a really weak one for me; but with my current lack of spare time, getting workouts in has been hard. Though I did hop on a rowing machine this morning.

In any case, I'm off to try and proofread this post and then get to learning. Go-go-gadget youtube!
