Summary: Over the hump in week 1. Definitely feeling pretty tired, for various reasons. But it's been great so far!

Gonna be a short post today, I'm pretty damn exhausted. First I'm going to update on the commitment I made last post about running. Yesterday morning I went for a run. Ended up just going around my neighborhood and not going to a nearby park. I think that made it easier. Both because I then had to rely on the distance tracker in RunKeeper, the app I use to track my runs, to decide how far to go, instead of randomly giving up part way around a park. Bad part about this, I'm not delegating enough time to stretching, and with all the recent running I've been doing my IT band decided to feel super tight today. Made sure to roll it out when I got home; that was __*SUPER*__ fun.

While I'm on the topic of working out. I acutally made it into the gym for the first time in 4 days to train some gymnastics. It felt hard, both because I put a timer on my workout (cause there's effectively a timer on my life now) and because I haven't been working out much lately. My saving grace is that I also haven't been eating much lately, motivated by the fact that I've been rather sedentary of late, and so my weight is lower than average for the last few months. No matter, I'll figure out a good workout schedule soon and get back into the swing of things.

Class today was great. We worked on SQL, which is, by far, the area where I have the beggest knowledge deficit, all day. By the end of the day I was putting together queries that I wouldn't have been able to understand at the start of the week. I'm not saying that I'm anywhere near groking the subject, just that I am starting to gain an intuition in the SQL sphere of thought.

Tomorrow we are going to learn how to implement SQL queries from python. I'm very excited about this, both because python is at least something I'm decent with, and because I understand that this is a __very__ useful skill to have.

Other cool things happening tomorrow; I'm going to be taking my 7 month old puppy, Maverick, to doggy day care for the first time. Hopefully he gets along well with the other dogs (I have no doubt that he will though) so that I can start bringing him there regularly. I think that he'll have a great time and it will certainly wear him out. Plus, you know what they say about a tired puppy? A tried puppy equals a happy owner.

In general, I'd say that I'm rather exhausted right now. I'm thinking this can be attributed to the fact that I'm not used to thinking for 9 hours straight yet. In addition, I'm just getting back into the groove of working out; there's certainly a learning curve there. And also, and possibly most importantly, I don't think that I have been nourishing myself properly the last few days. Both yesterday and today all I ate between the hours of 7 AM and 8 PM was two 26g servings of protein powder. Two green shakes with kale, carrot, banana, blueberries, spirulina and matcha.And a super greens salad with tomatoes, blueberries and about 6g of chicken breast. Oh! And a cup of coffee. Keep in mind, too, that during those hours I also did either a running or gymnastics workout. I know that I like everything on that list, everything is either very nourishing or stimulating or both; but I'm not sure what I want to add to it... I'll have to brainstorm tomorrow and figure it out; just to make sure that I don't collapse and die.

That's pretty much all I've got for now. I want to make my commitment to begin recording all of my food intake and workouts again. I know it was nice to see what I was intaking and how I was performing over time; simply from a motivation via comparision perspective; so I want to get back to that. And with that, go-go-gadget unconciousness!
