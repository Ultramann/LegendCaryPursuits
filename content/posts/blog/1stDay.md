Summary: Experiences from day one in DSI. Mostly just markdown practice and keeping my promise from yesterday.

Done with the first day, and like I promised, mostly myself, but you too, non-existent reader, here I am writing another post about it. The day started off with the typical, here's a rundown of what we'll be doing in the course. Did some introductions. There ended up being 9 of us in the class; but there is also a full-time teaching assistant, and another who will apparently only be here for weeks 1 & 7, so the student-teacher ratio is even better than I thought it would be previously. 

All of my peers seem smart, coming from backgrounds such as software development, commodities trading, economics and various hard sciences. It appears that no one is amazingly ahead of the curve and I'm super excited that I don't feel super far behind it. Anyways, then we got a tour of the building, cool stuff includes:

* Kitchen with general amenities including: coffee, tea, and snacks; there may have even been a beer tap there... (Note to self: check on that).  
* A gym with a decent looking pull-up bar. So I think I'll be able to do some actual workouts on it. Yay!  
* A ping-pong table in the basement. I got whooped by the TA in the one game we played, so trust me when I say that I'll be down there practicing a decent amount.  
* And almost every available surface is a white board. And who doesn't love white boards!!  
* In case you couldn't tell, I made this a bulleted list so that I could practice my markdown.  

Back in the class room we were given an initial assessment to complete in two hours. I guess they want a baseline of our knowledge, not that we haven't done a decent amount of work that would be indicative of that already... I felt like I knew basically everything except for the SQL queries. I definitely need to work on shoring up that deficiency. But the schedule (which I would link to for practice if it weren't in a private github repo) says we're going to work on it on Wednesday, so hopefully some practice will make me less ignorant.  

We, then, we're treated to lunch at Provo's by Galvanize. So thanks guys, how did you know I'm a sucker for pizza? Oh wait, everybody is a sucker for pizza!  

Back in class, we began our daily paired programming exercise. The assignment was broken down into three parts (can you guess that I'm going to do an ordered list now??):

1) A bunch of python questions working with python's data structures and file manipulation.  

2) Some questions on altering functions to be more optimal.  

3) A pretty hard question that asked us to do some data formatting.  

I was stoked about my group that ended up taking me, the odd one out, in - there are 9 of us, remember? The guy, Hugh, who was in the group is a software developer by trade, so he knows his python and git. It was awesome learning a couple of tricks from him. And the girl, Deseanae, is really new to python so I got to try my hand at explaining coding for the first time in over three years.  

Right around the time that my group finished part two, we headed to the happy hour that was being put on for the start of the Data Science Immersion (DSI) program. Approximately 75% of a beer later (don't worry, I finished the beer) we were back to trying to finish up the third part of the exercise. Luckily Hugh, knower of his shit, took the lead on this part and helped drag us through getting it done. By this time it was 7:30 pm. I was pretty tired, and have only eaten 2 green shakes, 4 slices of pizza, and 1 beer all day, I was ready to get out of there.  

I'm home now, haven't eaten anything else, and with this post almost done, ready to go to bed. On a slightly tangential note, after I wrote that go-go-gadget line yesterday I thought I'd try to make **it** my sign off, coming up with a new one each day. With that thought printed clearly in black and white on the interwebs, I feel like I definitely need to hit the hay. Go-go-gadget deep-fried brain!   

P.S. I think that I'm going to try to make a commitment at the end of each post. I've read some science behind how much more likely you are to follow through with something if you write it down; especially if you make it publicly. So today's commitment is going to be that I'm going to get up early enough to go for a run in the morning before class. I have a feeling I'm going to hate myself in 8 hours for writing those words...
